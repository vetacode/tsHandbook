// TypeScript has several type-checking strictness flags that can be turned on or off, and all of our examples will be written with all of them enabled unless otherwise stated.
// The strict flag in the CLI, or "strict": true in a tsconfig.json toggles them all on simultaneously
// We can opt out of them individually.
// The two biggest ones you should know about are noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks.
